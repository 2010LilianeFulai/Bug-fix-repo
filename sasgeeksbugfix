Not having a backup plan can make recovering from data loss or instance failure much more challenging.

Immediate Steps:
1. Stop any further data loss: Immediately stop using the instance to prevent further data loss or corruption.
2. Contact AWS Support: Reach out to AWS Support for guidance on the best course of action.
